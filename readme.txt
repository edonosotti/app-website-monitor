About
=====

Website Monitor is a free, basic tool to check your websites availability
over time and detect possible outages.
This applicaton was built for the Build-An-App Challenge, promoted by
the Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems course
on Coursera. This is the first release and probably needs some improvment,
do any feedback or contribution to improve it is welcome!

Caveats
=======

This application comes with no warranty, read the GNU GPLv3 carefully
and check the code before using it.
This application needs an active internet connection to work.
It works both with wi-fi and mobile data plan connection.
Be sure to check your carrier/ISP policies and tariffs, frequent
and intensive monitoring can generate a lot of traffic!
